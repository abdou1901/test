# Complexity Analysis\n### Time Complexity\nThe solution iterates over all corridors once in reverse order, and for each corridor, it performs constant-time operations. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of corridors.\nThis linear time complexity is efficient given the constraints.\n\n### Space Complexity\nWe use a fixed amount of extra space for the variables `c`, `d`, and `e`, as well as the arrays to store the operations, leading to O(1) additional space. The space complexity is determined by the input size.
