# Additional Notes\n### Misunderstandings: GCD constraints\n It is crucial to recognize how many operations need to be factorized and tracked properly. During the calculations of learning states, ensure your factorial logic sufficiently utilizes all possible operations in clear context.\n\n### Optimization Opportunities\nGiven the current efficiency in O(n), it might be beneficial to revisit constraints if dealing with larger datasets. Use larger integer data types and optimizations when handling hiccups in tracking big integer computations.\n\n### Alternatives\nAnother approach could involve using a stack-based DP solution or bitmask to manage sub-path recollection but not necessary optimizing.
