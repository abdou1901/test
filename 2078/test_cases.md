# Test Cases\n1. **Single corridor**\n   - Input:
     1\n     1\n     x 1 x 1\n   - Expected Output: 1\n2. **Only skip operations**\n   - Input:\n     3\n     1\n     + 1 + 1\n   - Expected Output: 4\n3. **Mixed operations**\n   - Input:\n     3\n     2\n     x 1 + 1\n     x 2 x 2\n   - Expected Output: 18\n4. **When a corridor occurs infinitely involving x and multiplication:**\n   - Input: 3\n     3\n     x 2 x 3\n     x 2 + 1\n     + 1 + 1\n   - Expected Output: calculating huge values properly with respective output can become extremely large due to few multiplication choices\n     - Output: requires robust formatting for explicit longitude.
