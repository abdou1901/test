# Solution Explanation
This problem involves processing mathematical expressions in postfix form (or Reverse Polish Notation). The solution reads an expression and uses a stack-based approach to evaluate it.
          
The program iterates through each character in the postfix expression and handles operands and operators accordingly. When it encounters an operand, it pushes it onto a stack. When it encounters an operator, it pops the required number of operands from the stack, performs the operation, and pushes the result back onto the stack. The result of the expression is the final value left on the stack.
           
### Problem Description
Process data for matrix size and pixel detection within it.
Given a matrix size (n) and a string of characters with operators and numbers, manipulate functions to compute a final result for given dataset.
           
### Logic Explanation
Through careful detection and placement, operators and operands are processed in a way to transform inputs/outputs.
A recursive function evaluates expressions, stepping backward to operate correctly on the values.
