# Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
To process a single test case, the algorithm needs to iterate through each character of the postfix expression and perform operations, resulting in time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the expression.
           
### Space Complexity
The necessary auxiliary space depends on the maximum depth of the operations stack, which in the worst case can be proportional to the number of operands in the expression. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of operands in the expression.
