# Additional Notes
The solution uses a straightforward postfix evaluation method, which is efficient for this type of problem due to its linear complexity. The main trick is handling the recursive nature of getting right operands for various operators.
           
### Alternative Implementation
For larger matrices or more complex evaluation logic, consider using a more flexible data structure like AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to manage expressions. Also, further satisfying the conditions might exceed the limits. 
           
### Edge Cases
When the expression string is empty, ensure to handle no input scenario carefully without leading to undefined behavior in edge cases.
