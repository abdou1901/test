The solution is concise and handles both positive and negative numbers effectively. One potential improvement could be early termination in the loop if the intermediate result exceeds the 32-bit signed integer range. However, the current solution already checks for this condition at the end of each iteration. The C language ensures that the integer math only creates 32-bit signed integers and skips values outside of the integer allowed range.

When implementing similar logic in another language, ensure to have robust range checks. Be cautious about how the language handles integer overflows. Most high-level languages do not handle overflows implicitly.
