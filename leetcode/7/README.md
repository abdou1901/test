## Problem Summary
The "Reverse Integer" problem on LeetCode involves reversing the digits of a 32-bit signed integer. The key challenge is to ensure that the reversed integer is still within the 32-bit signed integer range, taking overflow into account.

### Input/Output Description
- **Input**: A 32-bit signed integer.
- **Output**: The reversed integer, or 0 if the reversed integer overflows.

## Approach 
The solution involves:
1. Checking for overflow at the beginning.
2. Determining the sign of the integer.
3. Reversing the digits while checking for overflow after each step.
4. Returning the reversed integer with the correct sign.

## Code Walkthrough 
The code can be broken down as follows: 
```c
int reverse(int x){
    nd overflow 
    if(!x || x <= -2147483648) return 0;
    if(x > 2147483647) return 0;
    bool positive = true;
    if(x < 0){
        x = -x;
        positive = false;
    }
     long int result = 0;
    for(int i = x; i > 0; i /= 10){
        result = result * 10 + i % 10;
        if(result > 2147483647 || result < -2147483648) return 0;
    }
    return positive ? result : -result;
}
```
### Key Points
- **Sign Handling**: Converts negative numbers to positive to simplify the reversal process.
- **Overflow Check**: Ensures the result stays within the 32-bit signed integer range after each digit reversal.
- **Digit Reversal**: Extracts and appends the last digit to the result iteratively.

## Complexity Analysis 
- **Time Complexity**: O(log x). The algorithm processes each digit exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). Only a few extra variables are used, regardless of the input size.

## Test Cases
1. **Case 1**: Input = 123
   - Expected Output: 321
   - Explanation: Reversing the digits of 123 gives 321.
2. **Case 2**: Input = -123
    - Expected Output: -321
    - Explanation: Reversing the digits and adding back the sign.
3. **Case 3**: Input = 120
    - Expected Output: 21
    - Explanation: Trailing zeros are removed in the reversed number.
4. **Case 4**: Input = 0
    - Expected Output: 0
    - Explanation: Reversing 0 gives 0.
5. **Edge Case**: Input = 1534236469
   - Expected Output: 0
   - Explanation: Reversing this number is 9646324351, which overflows the 32-bit signed integer range.

## Extra Insights
- The initial check for overflow should be slightly modified. Checking x>0 and x<0 in single comparison will not catch signed overflow because both checks are stating the obvious x<0 when x<0 if(reverse x<-0 check).
