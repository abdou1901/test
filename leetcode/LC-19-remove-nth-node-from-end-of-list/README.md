## Problem Summary: Remove N-th Node From End of List
The problem asks us to remove the N-th node from the end of a singly linked list and return the modified list. This requires efficiently traversing the list and correctly identifying the node to be removed.

## Input/Output Description
- **Input**:
  - The head of a singly linked list.
  - An integer `n` representing the position from the end of the list to be removed.
- **Output**: The head of the modified linked list after removing the N-th node from the end.

## Approach
The solution uses the two-pointer technique to locate the N-th node from the end of the list. Here's the detailed approach:
1. **Initial Setup**: Create a dummy node that points to the head of the list. This simplifies edge cases when the head itself needs to be removed.
2. **Two Pointers**: Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the dummy node.
3. **Advance Fast Pointer**: Move the `fast` pointer `n+1` steps ahead. This creates a gap of `n` nodes between `slow` and `fast`.
4. **Traverse the List**: Move both `slow` and `fast` pointers one step at a time until `fast` reaches the end of the list. When this happens, `slow` will be just before the node to be removed.
5. **Remove the Node**: Adjust the `next` pointer of `slow` to skip the node to be removed, effectively removing it from the list.

## Code Walkthrough 
Here's the submitted solution explained:
```c
struct ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(struct ListNode* head, int n) {
    struct ListNode temp;
    temp.next = head;
    struct ListNode *slow = &temp, *fast = &temp;
    
    for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++){
        if(fast)
            fast = fast->next;
    }
    
    while (fast) {
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next;
    }
    
    struct ListNode* temp2 = slow->next;
    slow->next = slow->next->next;
    free(temp2);
    
    return temp.next;
}
```
### Key Points
- **Dummy Node**: The dummy node helps handle the case where the head of the list needs to be removed.
- **Two-Pointer Technique**: The `fast` pointer leads the `slow` pointer by `n` nodes. When `fast` reaches the end, `slow` is at the node just before the one to be removed.
- **Boundary Conditions**: The loop `for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++){` ensures that we handle cases where the list might be shorter than `n`.

## Complexity Analysis 
- **Time Complexity**: O(L). The solution requires a single pass through the list, where L is the length of the list.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). The solution uses a constant amount of extra space.
  Each step processes only a few variables and pointers, regardless of the list size. It doesn't need extra arrays or data structures.

## Test Cases
Let's test our function with a few examples:
1. **Case 1**: Input: [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
   - Expected Output: [1,2,3,5]
   - Explanation: Removing the 2nd node from the end gives [1,2,3,5]
2. **Case 2**: Input: [1], n = 1
   - Expected Output: []
   - Explanation: Removing the only node in the list results in an empty list.
3. **Case 3**: Input: [1,2], n = 1
   - Expected Output: [1]
   - Explanation: Removing the last node gives [1].
4. **Edge Case 1**: Input: [], n = 1
   - Expected Output: []
   - Explanation: An empty list remains empty.
5. **Edge Case 2**: Input: [1,2,3], n = 3
   - Expected Output: [2,3]
   - Explanation: Removing the first node gives [2,3].

## Extra Insights
- **Edge Conditions**: Ensuring that we handle very short lists and edge cases like removing the head of the list is crucial.
- **Alternative Ideas**: This approach can be adapted to solve variations of the problem, such as removing multiple nodes from the end.
