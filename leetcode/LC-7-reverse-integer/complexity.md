The **time complexity** is **O(n)**, where **n** is the number of digits in the integer. This is because the algorithm processes each digit exactly once.

The **space complexity** is **O(1)** because the algorithm uses only a fixed amount of extra space (for variables like 'result', 'i', etc.) regardless of the input size.
