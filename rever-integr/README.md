## Problem Summary
The "Reverse Integer" problem from LeetCode challenges you to reverse the digits of a 32-bit signed integer, ensuring the result stays within the 32-bit signed integer range. This means we need to handle potential overflow.
## Input/Output Description
- **Input**: The function takes a 32-bit signed integer as input.
- **Output**: The function returns the reversed integer, or 0 if reversing it causes an overflow.
## Approach 
1. First, handle overflow by checking if the input is out of the 32-bit range.
2. Determine and store the sign of the input number.
3. Reverse the integer.
4. Ensure that the resulting number is within the 32-bit signed integer range.
5. Return the reversed number with the correct sign.
### Code Walkthrough
The provided solution starts by checking for overflow conditions. Then, it reverses the digits by repeatedly extracting the last digit and appending it to the result, all while ensuring overflow doesn't occur.
```c
int reverse(int x){
    if(!x ||x >2147483647 || x <=-2147483648) return 0;
    bool positive = true;
    if(x < 0){
        x= -x;
        positive = false;
    }
    long int result = 0;
    for(int i  = x ; i >0 ; i/=10){
        result = result*10 + i % 10;
        if(result >2147483647 || result <-2147483648) return 0;
    }
    return positive? result : -result;
}
```
### Key Points
- **Initial Check**: The initial overflow check ensures that extreme values are handled correctly.
- **Sign Handling**: The solution determines if the number is positive or negative and handles the sign appropriately.
- **Reversal Logic**: The loop extracts the last digit of `x` and appends it to `result`, systematically reversing the number.
- **Overflow Handling**: After each addition, the solution checks if the result exceeds the 32-bit integer range.
## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(log x). The key operations are performed once per digit.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). Only a few extra variables are used.
### Edge Cases
- **Input**: All edge cases involving the maximum and minimum 32-bit integers, zero, and extremely large or small numbers should be considered.
## Test Cases
1. **Input**: 123
   - **Expected Output**: 321
2. **Input**: -123
   - **Expected Output**: -321
3. **Input**: 120
   - **Expected Output**: 21
4. **Input**: 0
   - **Expected Output**: 0
5. **Edge Case (Overflow)**: 1534236469
   - **Expected Output**: 0
## Extra Insights
- **Overflow Management**: By checking for overflow after every digit reversal, the solution maintains reliability and correctness.
- **Edge Handling**: Ensure to test edge cases like the boundaries of 32-bit integers and zero for complete coverage.
