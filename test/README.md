The problem is about reversing the digits of a 32-bit signed integer, and it should handle edge cases, such as numbers where reversing them results in values outside the 32-bit signed integer range.

**Logic:**
1. The code checks if the input number `x` is zero or out of the 32-bit signed integer range initially. If so, it returns 0.
2. It keeps track of whether the original number is positive or negative.
3. If the number is negative, it converts it to positive temporarily for easier manipulation.
4. The main loop iterates through each digit of the number, building the reversed number step by step.
5. During each iteration, it appends the last digit of the number to the result, and shifts the digits of the number to the right.
6. After reversing the digits, if the number was originally negative, the result is made negative again.
7. If the reversed number exceeds the 32-bit signed integer range, it returns 0.
